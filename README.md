This The Frist  Markdown file 
In this notebook, I will summarize some of the key tools, libraries, and languages used by data scientists. This is the final assignment for the Data Science Tools course.

## Some of the popular languages used by Data Scientists include:

1. Python  
2. R  
3. SQL  
4. Julia  
5. Scala  

## Commonly used libraries by Data Scientists:

1. Pandas  
2. NumPy  
3. Matplotlib  
4. Scikit-learn  
5. TensorFlow  
6. ggplot2  

## Examples of Data Science Tools

| Tool            | Type              | Usage                        |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| RStudio         | IDE               | R language development        |
| Apache Spark    | Big Data Platform | Large-scale data processing   |
| TensorFlow      | ML Library        | Deep learning models          |

### Below are examples of simple arithmetic operations using Python:

# This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply and then add integers
(5 * 4) + 3

# This will convert 200 minutes to hours
minutes = 200
hours = minutes / 60
hours

## Objectives of this notebook:
- List data science languages  
- List data science libraries  
- Show tools used in data science  
- Practice arithmetic operations  
- Convert time from minutes to hours
